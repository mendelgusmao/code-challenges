# Code challenges

This is a collection of all recent code challenges that I participated in. I hope it provides some guidance for new developers as well as being a portfolio of my software development skills.

## Disclaimer

- I won't tell explicitly who are the employers that sent me the challenges
- Although, some of them can be inferred by taking some look at the code
- The code is left untouched after delivered, which means that...
- I won't modify the code for censoring purposes if the employer is somehow identified
- I won't provide the challenge requirements
- I will publish a finished challenge after a reasonable period of time to protect my application and the employer's hiring process
